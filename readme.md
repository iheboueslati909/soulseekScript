## Personal DJ Tool Project
A hobby of mine is DJing, which involves digging for music, a task that consumes a lot of time and energy. To minimize this, I'm developing a tool to streamline the process.

# Technical Workflow
## Steps and Their Status
**Chrome Extension:**

Status: Not started

Function: A shortcut icon on the website "cosine.club" that I use for digging. When clicked, it will get the track's name and perform the automated action.

**Windows Batch Script:**

Status: Done, needs optimization

Function:
Performs the "paste-enter" (search) action into Soulseek.

# Current concerns
- For the batch script to work, Soulseek's window must be open in the taskbar (it doesn't matter if it's in the background).

- Soulseek's search bar must be unfocused.
